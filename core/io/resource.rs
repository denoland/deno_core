// resources. Resources may or may not correspond to a real operating system
// file descriptor (hence the different name).

/// Resources are Rust objects that are attached to a [deno_core::JsRuntime].
/// They are identified in JS by a numeric ID (the resource ID, or rid).
/// Resources can be created in ops. Resources can also be retrieved in ops by
/// their rid. Resources are not thread-safe - they can only be accessed from
/// the thread that the JsRuntime lives on.
///
/// Resources are reference counted in Rust. This means that they can be
/// cloned and passed around. When the last reference is dropped, the resource
/// is automatically closed. As long as the resource exists in the resource
/// table, the reference count is at least 1.
///
/// ### Readable
///
/// Readable resources are resources that can have data read from. Examples of
/// this are files, sockets, or HTTP streams.
///
/// Readables can be read from from either JS or Rust. In JS one can use
/// `Deno.core.read()` to read from a single chunk of data from a readable. In
/// Rust one can directly call `read()` or `read_byob()`. The Rust side code is
/// used to implement ops like `op_slice`.
///
/// A distinction can be made between readables that produce chunks of data
/// themselves (they allocate the chunks), and readables that fill up
/// bring-your-own-buffers (BYOBs). The former is often the case for framed
/// protocols like HTTP, while the latter is often the case for kernel backed
/// resources like files and sockets.
///
/// All readables must implement `read()`. If resources can support an optimized
/// path for BYOBs, they should also implement `read_byob()`. For kernel backed
/// resources it often makes sense to implement `read_byob()` first, and then
/// implement `read()` as an operation that allocates a new chunk with
/// `len == limit`, then calls `read_byob()`, and then returns a chunk sliced to
/// the number of bytes read. Kernel backed resources can use the
/// [deno_core::impl_readable_byob] macro to implement optimized `read_byob()`
/// and `read()` implementations from a single `Self::read()` method.
///
/// ### Writable
///
/// Writable resources are resources that can have data written to. Examples of
/// this are files, sockets, or HTTP streams.
///
/// Writables can be written to from either JS or Rust. In JS one can use
/// `Deno.core.write()` to write to a single chunk of data to a writable. In
/// Rust one can directly call `write()`. The latter is used to implement ops
/// like `op_slice`.
pub trait Resource: Any + 'static {
  /// Returns a string representation of the resource which is made available
  /// to JavaScript code through `op_resources`. The default implementation
  /// returns the Rust type name, but specific resource types may override this
  /// trait method.

    type_name::<Self>().into()

  /// `BufView` that represents the data that was read. If a zero length buffer
  /// is returned, it indicates that the resource has reached EOF.
  ///

  /// with a "not supported" error.

  /// implement `read_byob()`.
